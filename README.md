This is a basic Snake game implemented in js. It's a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing in length. The game is built as a fun and educational project to help me in learning basics of js,html and css.

<h1>Features</h1>
<b>Snake Control:</b> Control the snake's movement using arrow keys (or other input methods if applicable).<br>
<b>Food:</b> Randomly generated food items appear on the screen for the snake to eat.<br>
<b>Scoring:</b> Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items eaten.<br>
<b>Collision Detection:</b> Implement collision detection to end the game when the snake hits the wall or itself.<br>
<b>Growth:</b> The snake grows longer each time it eats food.<br>
